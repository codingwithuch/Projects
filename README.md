# Projects
These are projects that inspired me to learn python. Rather than looking up random project ideas this is a project I came up with all on my own. Graph connector real is based of a project given to me senior year of high school where we were tasked to use functions to discribe a path for a rollercoster. Having spent hours working on the project i found a simple way to connect 3rd degree polynomial given that they share a common endpoint and at the endpoint they share a min/max. I have a document typed up that shows the thought process and math behind it (Graph Connector PDF).
