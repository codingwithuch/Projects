# Projects
Note: I am due for doing some clean up, ignore this page for a bit, im trying to put a new project here as well but im still new to github so it will take a little bit, I should have this cleaned up by Nov 12th

(Note: Some of my project were made on spyder, you may need to edit the code/add the proper plugin)This is the project that inspired me to learn python. Rather than looking up random project ideas this is a project I came up with all on my own. Graph connector real is based of a project given to me senior year of high school where we were tasked to use functions to discribe a path for a rollercoster. Having spent hours working on the project I found a simple way to connect any two points using 3rd degree polynomial with the extra bonus of having the derivative at the two points being zero. I have a document typed up that shows the thought process and math behind it (Graph Connector PDF).
