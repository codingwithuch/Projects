(Note: Some of my project were made on spyder, you may need to edit the code/add the proper plugin)This is the project that inspired me to learn Python. Rather than looking up random project ideas, this is a project I came up with all on my own. Graph connector real is based on a project given to me in my senior year of high school where we were tasked to use functions to describe a path for a rollercoaster. Having spent hours working on the project I found a simple way to connect any two points using 3rd degree polynomial with the bonus of having the derivative at the two points being zero. I have a typed document showing the thought process and math behind it (Graph Connector PDF). 

My newest project is a Wordle project, involving the files, test, test2, and wordspopup. This project was created because I wanted to see how well I could match the actual Wordle algorithm. Using matrixes I found an algorithm that did not give out points too generously. I encourage you to take a look at the code, it is quite dense but you will find the solution interesting.
